Please create a flask app. App should have PostgreSQL integration that includes all the functionalities of a simple to-do app, and also implement user profiles. App should allow users to: Create a new account or log-in with existing credentials. Create, read, update, and delete tasks in their to-do list. Mark tasks as completed or incomplete. Organize tasks into categories or tags. Set due dates and priorities for tasks. View their own to-do list. Edit their profile information, including username and password. Log out from their account securely. Ensure that the PostgreSQL database is used to store user account information, task data, and user profiles. Implement user authentication and session management for secure access to user-specific data. Flask to-do app should follow best practices in terms of code structure, security, and user experience. It should also have clear and user-friendly interfaces for both task management and user profile management.
